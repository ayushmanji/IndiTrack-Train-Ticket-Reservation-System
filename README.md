### ========== Dummy Database Initialization ===========

STEP 1: Open SQL Plus OR SQL Developer.

STEP 2: Login to Oracle using admin credentials (username and password).

STEP 3 :Execute the below command first to create a new user:

```SQL

ALTER SESSION SET "_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=TRUE;
CREATE USER RESERVATION IDENTIFIED BY MANAGER;
GRANT DBA TO RESERVATION;
COMMIT;

```

NOTE:

- ALTER SESSION SET "\_ORACLE_SCRIPT"=TRUE; allows creating a user with the necessary privileges in Oracle.

- CREATE USER RESERVATION IDENTIFIED BY MANAGER; creates a new database user named RESERVATION with the password MANAGER.

- GRANT DBA TO RESERVATION; gives this user full database administrator privileges to manage schema objects and data.

- COMMIT; saves these changes permanently to the database.

STEP 4: Now execute the below sql query in same terminal

```SQL

CONNECT RESERVATION/MANAGER;
CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."CUSTOMER"
(
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) PRIMARY KEY,
"PWORD" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"FNAME" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"LNAME" VARCHAR2(20),
"ADDR" VARCHAR2(100),
"PHNO" NUMBER(12) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."ADMIN"
(
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) PRIMARY KEY,
"PWORD" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"FNAME" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"LNAME" VARCHAR2(20),
"ADDR" VARCHAR2(100),
"PHNO" NUMBER(12) NOT NULL
);


CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."TRAIN"
(
"TR_NO" NUMBER(10) PRIMARY KEY,
"TR_NAME" VARCHAR2(70) NOT NULL,
"FROM_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"TO_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"SEATS" NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
"FARE" NUMBER(6,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE "RESERVATION"."HISTORY"
(
"TRANSID" VARCHAR2(36) PRIMARY KEY,
"MAILID" VARCHAR2(40) REFERENCES "RESERVATION"."CUSTOMER"(MAILID),
"TR_NO" NUMBER(10),
"DATE" DATE,
"FROM_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"TO_STN" VARCHAR2(20) NOT NULL,
"SEATS" NUMBER(3) NOT NULL,
"AMOUNT" NUMBER(8,2) NOT NULL
);

COMMIT;

INSERT INTO RESERVATION.ADMIN VALUES('admin@gmail.com','admin','System','Admin','Demo Address 123 colony','9123456789');

INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10001, 'UDAIPUR CITY EXP', 'UDAIPUR', 'JAIPUR', 120, 320.00);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10002, 'MARUDHAR EXP', 'JODHPUR', 'JAIPUR', 100, 270.50);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10003, 'RANAKPUR EXP', 'BIKANER', 'UDAIPUR', 80, 295.00);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10004, 'ARAVALI EXP', 'AJMER', 'MOUNT ABU', 90, 310.00);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10005, 'Chetak Express', 'UDAIPUR', 'DELHI', 110, 460.75);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.TRAIN VALUES(10006, 'PINK CITY EXP', 'JAIPUR', 'DELHI', 130, 510.25);

INSERT INTO RESERVATION.HISTORY VALUES('RJ001-TRN-1001','ayush@gmail.com',10001,TO_DATE('10-FEB-2024'), 'UDAIPUR', 'JAIPUR', 2, 640.00);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.HISTORY VALUES('RJ002-TRN-1004','ayush@gmail.com',10004,TO_DATE('15-MAR-2024'), 'AJMER', 'MOUNT ABU', 1, 310.00);
INSERT INTO RESERVATION.HISTORY VALUES('RJ003-TRN-10006','ayush@gmail.com',10006,TO_DATE('25-APR-2024'), 'JAIPUR', 'DELHI', 3, 1530.75);

COMMIT;
```

NOTE:

- CONNECT RESERVATION/MANAGER; logs in as the RESERVATION user with password MANAGER to run subsequent commands.

- The CREATE TABLE statements create four tables:

  -CUSTOMER: Stores user details like email, password, name, address, and phone number.

  -ADMIN: Stores admin user details similar to CUSTOMER.

  -TRAIN: Contains train info including train number, name, origin & destination stations, available seats, and fare.

  -HISTORY: Logs ticket booking transactions with unique IDs, user email (linked to CUSTOMER), train number, travel date, journey stations, number of seats booked, and total amount paid.

- COMMIT; saves all table creations.

- The INSERT INTO commands add sample records for admin, customer, trains, and booking history for testing purposes.

- The final COMMIT; ensures all inserted data is saved permanently.

STEP 5: Now Execute the below query one by one to check if the tables are created successfully

```SQL
SELECT * FROM ADMIN;
SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER;
SELECT * FROM TRAIN;
SELECT * FROM HISTORY;

```

Note:

- These SELECT queries retrieve all records from each table (ADMIN, CUSTOMER, TRAIN, HISTORY).

- Running them helps confirm that the tables exist and the sample data was inserted correctly.
